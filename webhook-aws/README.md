# AWS-flavored Webhook-triggered SDL backup

This is the same demo as the [Webhook demo](../webhook), but uses AWS
infrastructure. It uses [CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/index.html) to provision:

- An S3 bucket for storing supergraph schema backups.
- A Lambda function for receiving the Build Notification webhook from Studio.
- A Lambda function that serves as a fallback for the supergraph delivery Uplink API.
- A Lambda function for serving the gateway using [apollo-server-lambda](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-server-lambda). **This is just for demonstration purposes. Your gateway can live anywhere, as long as it can make requests to the fallback supergraph delivery lambda function.**
- API Gateways for routing to HTTP requests to the Lambda functions.
- Support for secure webhooks using a secret.

The gateway example uses a custom fetcher that falls back to the Lambda function
if the Uplink request fails.

## Try it out

Prerequisites to run this demo:

- Node 14 or greater and Yarn
- The [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and an AWS account
- A federated graph in Apollo Studio

Steps:

1. Obtain AWS credentials and export them as environment variables for
   subsequent commands.

   ```sh
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ABCD1234EFGH7890
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=AbcD/eFGHijKLmnoPQRsTuvWXyZ
   ```

2. Obtain an Apollo API key with at least the Contributor role for your Gateway.
   Export the key and a graph ref for subsequent commands.

   ```sh
   export APOLLO_KEY=service:mygraph:Abcd1234EfgH5678
   export APOLLO_GRAPH_REF=mygraph@current
   ```

3. Generate a secret for the webhook.

   ```sh
   export WEBHOOK_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 20)
   ```

4. Put Apollo key and webhook key in AWS Secrets Manager.

   ```sh
   aws secretsmanager create-secret --name apollo-key --secret-string $APOLLO_KEY
   aws secretsmanager create-secret --name webhook-key --secret-string $WEBHOOK_KEY
   ```

   After each create command, copy the ARN for the secret and paste it into `infra/cdk.context.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789000:secret:webhook-key-123456",
     "Name": "webhook-key",
     "VersionId": "12345678-888d-40ac-a348-89499a47cb64"
   }
   ```

   The cdk.context.json will look like this:

   ```json
   {
     "webhookKeyArn": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789000:secret:webhook-key-123456",
     "apolloKeyArn": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789000:secret:apollo-key-123456"
   }
   ```

5. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

6. Bootstrap your CDK stack

   ```sh
   yarn workspace infra cdk bootstrap
   ```

7. Build the Lambda functions

   ```sh
   yarn workspace gateway build
   yarn workspace webhook-handler build
   ```

8. Deploy your stack

   ```sh
   yarn workspace infra cdk deploy
   ```

   After the deploy is complete, the output will contain URLs for both the
   gateway and webhook handlers:

   ```
   âœ…  InfraStack

   Outputs:
   InfraStack.gatewayurl = https://abcd1234.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
   InfraStack.webhookurl = https://zyxw0987.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
   ```

9. Create a notification channel [by running this operation in Studio][channelop].
   Before executing the operation, ensure to include:

   - An `x-api-key` header for your graph admin API key (this key must be have
     the Graph Admin role or higher)
   - The `$WEBHOOK_KEY` secret as the `secretToken` variable
   - The webhook API endpoint as the `url` variable

   ```json
   {
     "serviceId": "mygraph",
     "name": "aws-fallback-webhook",
     "secretToken": "abcd1234efgh5678",
     "url": "https://zyxw0987.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
   }
   ```

10. Visit Studio to create a Build Status notification using the channel created
    in the previous step.

11. Trigger a launch by publishing a subgraph change to your graph with Rover

    ```sh
    rover subgraph publish mygraph@current --name products --schema products.graphql
    ```

12. Visit Sandbox for your gateway Lambda function

    ```sh
    open "https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer?endpoint=https://abcd1234.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/"
    ```

    The gateway example is purposefully broken and will never successfully fetch
    the supergraph schema from Studio's Uplink API. So if you see a schema in
    Sandbox, then the fallback function is working.
